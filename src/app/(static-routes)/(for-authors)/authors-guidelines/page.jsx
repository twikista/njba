          Authorship should be limited to those who have made significant
          contributions to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation
          of the research. Individuals with lesser contributions should be
          acknowledged in the manuscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authors should carefully consider and finalize the list and order of
          authors before submission. Changes to authorship after submission will
          only be considered in exceptional circumstances and must be clearly
          communicated to the Editor. All authors must agree to any changes.

          Errors discovered by the author after submission but before approval
          for publication should be communicated swiftly to the editor of the
          Journal before the end of the review process.
        </p>

          If significant errors are identified in published works, authors are
          obligated to inform the editor immediately and cooperate in correcting
          or retracting the paper if necessary. If errors are reported by third
          parties, authors must also assist the editor as required.
