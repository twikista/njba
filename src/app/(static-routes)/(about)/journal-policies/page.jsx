        <H2>Peer Review Policy</H2>
        <p>
          The MSR employs a double-blind peer review process to ensure
          objectivity and impartiality. This means that both the identities of
          the authors and reviewers are concealed from each other throughout the
          review process.

              Review Process:
            </span>
            Each manuscript submitted will be evaluated by at least two
            independent reviewers who are experts in the field. Reviewers will
            assess the manuscript based on originality, significance,
            methodology, clarity, and adherence to ethical standards.

              Timeliness:
            </span>
            Reviewers are expected to complete their evaluations within four
            weeks. If delays occur, they should notify the editorial team
            promptly.

            suggestions for improvement when applicable.
